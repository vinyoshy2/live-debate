We believe that when forced to divide their attention between two things, people with strong prior beliefs will display bias in what they actually remember from the debate. Similarly, we hypothesize that comments can have a priming effect on participants, and making them more or less likely to believe an argument depending on when they see the comment."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"You may have noticed our initial description of our research goals are not the same as described here.
