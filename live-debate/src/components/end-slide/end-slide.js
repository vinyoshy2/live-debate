            <h2>Dual Screen Bias Debrief Form</h2>
            <p>Thank you for participating in this study!  We hope you enjoyed the experience.  This form provides background about our research to help you learn more about why we are doing this study. Please feel free to ask any questions or to comment on any aspect of the study.</p>
            <p>You have just participated in a research study conducted by Karrie Karahalios and Vinay Koshy at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.</p>
            <p>This experiment was designed to understand how media multitasking affects people's understanding of political issues. Each participant was either shown the debate and comments one at a time, or asked to watch the debate and read comments at the same time. A past study found that around 20% of debate watchers report that they engage with social media while watching the debate. We believe that when forced to divide their attention between two things, people with strong prior beliefs will display bias in what they actually remember from the debate. Similarly, we hypothesize that comments can have a priming effect on participants, and making them more or less likely to believe an argument depending on when they see the comment.</p>
            <p>You may have noticed our initial description of our research goals are not the same as described here. This wass intentional, as a participant who is aware that this study is about bias, may make a more conscious effort to remain neutral throughout the study. Once again, your participation is wholly voluntary. If you so wish, you may ask to have your results withdrawn after reading this form. You will still receive payment even if you choose to do so, and all records of your participation will be destroyed. Please email vkoshy2@illinois.edu if you'd like to do so. You make keep, or download a copy of this debriefing form for your records.</p>
            <h2>This concludes the study. Thanks you for participating! Once again, please direct any questions or concerns you may have to vkoshy2@illinois.edu</h2>
